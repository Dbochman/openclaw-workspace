# 2026-02-06 - Session Summary

## Major Accomplishments

### Infrastructure & Automation
- Fixed Philips Hue bash 4+ compatibility issues
- Set up Nest thermostat monitoring with 30-min snapshots + <40°F alerting
- Installed curl_cffi for Chrome TLS impersonation (failed for OpenTable bot detection)
- Configured headless Chromium browser with Playwright for web automation
- Verified browser optimization suite (efficient snapshots, headless mode, JavaScript eval)

### Restaurant Bookings & Calendar
- Successfully booked Juliet via Resy (3/20/2026, party of 2)
- Created 9 monthly cron jobs for automated date night booking (April-Dec 2026)
- Verified Google Calendar event creation with Julia invitations working

### Music & Andre Queue
- Added 50+ curated songs (Pretty Lights, Gramatik, Tycho, Madlib, jazz, Japanese)
- Set up Andre REST API authentication with bearer token
- Confirmed queue management and song addition workflows functional

### Educational Tracking
- Found and parsed Julia's Monty Tech course registrations from email
- Created calendar events for both Spring 2026 courses
- Invited Dylan to all class sessions

### Email & Communication
- Drafted professional reply to Hamed Silatani about simulation participation
- Confirmed Gmail integration working with test heart emoji send

## Known Limitations

- **OpenTable bot detection**: Persistent despite headless optimization + TLS impersonation; Resy works reliably
- **DigitalOcean SSH**: Disabled for security (not blocking Andre functionality)

## Decision Log

- **Resy over OpenTable**: CLI-based booking reliable; use browser fallback only if needed
- **Temperature alerts**: 30-min snapshots sufficient; removed dedicated alert cron job
- **Browser configuration**: headless + efficient snapshots for token optimization
- **Email parsing**: Always check multi-part HTML thoroughly for multiple course listings

## Next Phase

- Monitor first April 1st automated booking to validate monthly workflow
- Continue optimizing Andre queue based on listening patterns
- Track Nest temperature data for seasonal trends
- Follow Hamed's response about simulation participation details
