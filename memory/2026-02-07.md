# 2026-02-07 - First Full Day Online

## Major Accomplishments

### Home Automation Setup
- Fixed bash 3.2 compatibility issue in `hue` script (replaced `${var,,}` with `tr` for lowercase)
- Successfully controlling Philips Hue lights (all rooms)
- Nest thermostat control working with API token from 1Password
- Kitchen speaker Bluetooth + Spotify Connect playback working

### Dating & Calendar
- **Booked first date night:** Juliet (French) in Newton, March 20, 2026 at 7 PM (2 people)
- Created 9 monthly date night cron jobs for April-December 2026:
  - April: Italian, May: Mediterranean, June: Spanish/Tapas, July: Japanese/Asian
  - August: Farm-to-Table, September: American/Steakhouse, October: Indian
  - November: Modern American, December: Upscale/Special
- Each runs on 1st of month, books Friday dinner for 2 at 7 PM in Newton/Brookline
- Julia invited to all calendar events via julia.joy.jennings@gmail.com

### Music Queue (Andre)
- Added 30+ tracks total:
  - 10 jazz-influenced chill tracks (Bill Evans, Keith Jarrett, Robert Glasper, etc.)
  - 10 Japanese instrumental/ambient tracks (Nujabes, Shigure, etc.)
  - 10 instrumental electronic/downtempo tracks (Tycho, Flying Lotus, Bonobo, etc.)
- Paused playback for night successfully

### Cron Jobs Created
1. **Analytics Check (every 48 hours):** Personal website traffic + open PRs
2. **Temperature Alert (every 30 minutes):** Monitor Living Room/Bedroom for temps <40°F
3. **Monthly Date Night Bookings (9 jobs):** April-December 2026, 1st of each month

### Browser & Automation
- Browser optimizations applied successfully:
  - Managed headless Chromium profile
  - Efficient snapshot mode (compact output, fewer tokens)
  - JavaScript evaluation enabled
  - Amazon loads perfectly
  - OpenTable still blocked (HTTP/2 protocol error - strong bot detection)
- Resy API works reliably for restaurant bookings

### Group Chat Discovery
- **Bug Found & Fixed:** imsg send to group chat requires `--to "7010feab69b14fa19071a88340495f2f"` (chat identifier), not `--chat-id 170`
- Updated imsg skill documentation
- Dylan emphasized: must respond in group chat every time (not just acknowledge in main session)

### Data & Monitoring
- Nest temperature snapshots set up (every 30 minutes) → `~/.openclaw/nest-history/`
- Last snapshot: Feb 7 at 2:38 PM (Living Room: 71.8°F, Bedroom: 68.5°F, Solarium: 62.5°F)
- Note: Snapshot cron job not visible in cron list - may need debugging

## Technical Learnings

**OpenTable:** Strong bot detection. CLI works but booking API returns 409 errors. Use Resy instead.

**Resy:** Works perfectly. API reliable, booking successful (tested with Juliet).

**Group Chat:** Must use chat identifier string with `--to`, not numeric ID with `--chat-id`.

**Nest Data:** Snapshot command works but cron automation not capturing overnight data yet.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Debug why nest snapshot cron job isn't in active list
2. Investigate group chat messaging issue further (why messages didn't appear initially)
3. Monitor first temperature alert test tomorrow
4. Check analytics job runs tomorrow morning

## Preferences Learned
- Dylan: Proactive communication, prefers group chat responses
- Julia: Likes good vegetable dishes at restaurants
- Both: Date nights 7 PM, Newton/Brookline area preferred, varied cuisines
