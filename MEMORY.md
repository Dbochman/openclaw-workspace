## Infrastructure Changes

**2026-05-23:**
- Vacancy script upgraded: Eight Sleep now uses `away start`/`end` (proper away mode) instead of `off`/`on` (simple thermal pause). Better for extended absences.
- 8sleep CLI refactored with `--location <crosstown|cabin>` flag for future second Pod support
- Historical: BB routing improvements deployed to SOUL.md and TOOLS.md — `any;-;` chat GUIDs avoided old BlueBubbles lookup timeouts. This no longer applies to normal operation after native iMessage cutover.

**2026-06-27:**
- OpenClaw completed its migration from BlueBubbles to native `imsg`-backed iMessage. Active sends use `channel: imessage` and stable targets `chat_id:171` (Dylan), `chat_id:1` (Julia), and `chat_id:170` (Dylan+Julia group).
- The retired BlueBubbles plugin, app, services, state, and credentials were removed. `vacancy-actions.sh` now sends lock notifications directly through native `imsg` to `chat_id:171`.

**2026-04-05:**
- August smart lock skill deployed and verified working (Crosstown front door: locked, 96% battery, WiFi -47dBm)
- Lock integrated into vacancy-actions.sh — auto-locks when Crosstown becomes confirmed_vacant
- crosstown-routines skill updated with note not to duplicate vacancy automation

**2026-03-06:**
- Base model upgraded to **claude-opus-4-6** (from claude-sonnet-4-6)
- Cron jobs: 3 qd-booking payloads migrated from `gog calendar create` → `gws calendar events insert` (synced to Mini)
- Refresh script: Removed stale `GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD`; added `BLUEBUBBLES_PASSWORD`, `CIELO_USERNAME`, `CIELO_PASSWORD` (synced to Mini)

## Dog Walk Automation (rewritten 2026-04-04)

**Architecture:** Fi GPS collar → departure detection → Roomba automation → multi-signal return monitoring. Replaced old Ring vision pipeline (removed Haiku video analysis, FindMy/Peekaboo, accumulator windows).

**Skills:** `dog-walk` (listener + automation), `fi-collar` (GPS/battery queries), `ring-doorbell` (Ring CLI, dings only now)

**Listener** (`ai.openclaw.dog-walk-listener` LaunchAgent, 1354 lines):
- Fi GPS polling every 3 min during walk hours (7AM-12PM, 12-5PM, 5-9PM)
- Departure: 2 consecutive Fi readings outside geofence, ≥3 min apart, both <10 min old
- Tracks `home_location` (last confirmed in-geofence home) as departure anchor
- Ring FCM push still used for ding alerts + return motion signal (not departure)

**Return Detection** (multi-signal, any one docks):
- Ring doorbell motion (event-driven)
- WiFi/ARP scan every 60s (Crosstown via MBP SSH, Cabin via Starlink gRPC)
- Fi GPS every 60s (Potato re-enters home geofence)
- 2-hour safety timeout fallback

**Route Tracking:**
- Per-walk route files: `~/.openclaw/dog-walk/routes/<location>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<walk_id>.json`
- Includes distance_m, point_count, end_location, inter-home transit filtering
- Immutable walk_id + origin_location at departure

**Dashboard** (`ai.openclaw.dog-walk-dashboard` on port 8552):
- Leaflet maps with route polylines + heatmap layers
- Fi collar status (battery, GPS, activity)
- Roomba status (both houses — Crosstown via SSH/dorita980, Cabin via iRobot cloud)
- Walk log table, duration/signal/funnel charts
- Click-to-select walk routes on map

**State:** `~/.openclaw/dog-walk/state.json` + daily JSONL in `history/`

**Devices:** Crosstown doorbell (684794187, Ring Protect), Cabin doorbell (697442349, shared, no Ring Protect)

**Crosstown Roombas** (`crosstown-roomba` skill):
- Roomba Combo 10 Max + Scoomba J5 via dorita980 MQTT through MacBook Pro SSH

**August Lock** (`august-lock` skill, deployed 2026-04-05):
- August Wi-Fi Smart Lock 4th gen at Crosstown front door
- CLI: `august status|lock|unlock|locks|details`
- Architecture: Mini → SSH → MBP → august-api npm → August Cloud
- Auth: dylanbochman@gmail.com, JWT token (~120 day expiry), installId cached on MBP
- Config: `~/.openclaw/august/config.json` on MBP

**Vacancy Automation** (`vacancy-actions.sh`, WatchPaths on presence state.json):
- Crosstown vacant → lights off, eco mode, Cielo off, Eight Sleep off, **front door locked**, Roombas start, iMessage notification to Dylan
- Crosstown occupied → Eight Sleep restored, vacancy marker cleared
- Cabin vacant → lights off, eco mode, Roombas start
- Cabin occupied → marker cleared
- Lock logic: checks if already locked first, sends different iMessage for already-locked vs newly-locked vs failed
- Marker files in `~/.openclaw/presence/vacancy-dispatched/` prevent duplicate runs

## Presence Detection Fix (2026-03-24)
- Fixed stale ARP entries causing false presence at Crosstown
- Crosstown scan now: delete tracked ARP entries → re-ping (layer 2) → read fresh ARP table
- Prevents "person left but ARP entry persists" false relocations
- Deployed to both machines

## FindMy Locate (deployed 2026-04-04)

**Skill:** `findmy-locate` — locates Dylan/Julia via Apple FindMy using Peekaboo keyboard automation + screenshot capture.

**Usage notes:**
- `findmy-locate dylan`, `findmy-locate julia`, `findmy-locate both`
- Returns JSON with screenshot path → read the image to interpret the map location
- Screenshots saved to `~/.openclaw/findmy-locate/` (no auto-cleanup, prune manually with `find -mtime +7`)
- Copy screenshot to workspace before using `image` tool (findmy-locate dir isn't in allowed paths)

**Sidebar order (fixed 2026-04-04):** Me (0) → Dylan (1) → Julia (2)
- Script positions are correct: Dylan=1, Julia=2
- `both` mode: single pass — Dylan first, then Julia (no re-open)
- If someone gets added/removed from FindMy, sidebar order may shift — check visually

**TCC requirements:**
- Peekaboo needs Screen Recording + Accessibility grants
- Grants must cover the process context OpenClaw runs under (not just Terminal.app)
- If capture fails with "Screen recording permission required", re-grant in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording

**Integration:** Pairs well with `places` skill for follow-up queries ("what's near them", "how far from home")

## Todos / Backlog

- **Harden memory handling for untrusted sessions** — MEMORY.md is injected into all DM sessions including strangers. Plan: (1) split PII out of MEMORY.md into `memory/private.md` (not auto-injected), (2) add SOUL.md rule to go memory-blind with untrusted contacts, (3) longer-term: OpenClaw bootstrap hook to gate injection by session type.


## Key Contacts

- **Renee Murphy** (+1-774-244-1474): Dylan's mother. Fully trusted as of 2026-06-27; may access private household context and trigger any action. Native iMessage DM is `chat_id:15`; Dylan + Renee group is `chat_id:178`.
- **Hamed Silatani** (hamed@uptimelabs.io): Security/incident response simulation workshops; draft reply pending in Gmail
