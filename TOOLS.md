# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## QMD (Markdown Search)

CLI at `/opt/homebrew/bin/qmd`. Local hybrid search (BM25 + vector) over all OpenClaw docs. **Use this when you need details not in this file** — device IDs, API endpoints, curl examples, troubleshooting steps, etc.

```bash
qmd query "native imessage migration"         # hybrid search (recommended)
qmd search "cart URL"                         # keyword-only search
qmd get qmd://skills/grocery-reorder/skill.md # read a specific doc
```

Four collections indexed: `workspace` (SOUL/TOOLS/HEARTBEAT), `skills` (all SKILL.md files), `plans` (native iMessage migration, archived BB implementation, Private API, workspace state), `bin-scripts` (README, weekly upgrade doc).

## Smart Home Devices

### Cabin (Philly)
- Philips Hue lights
- iRobot Roombas (Floomba + Philly)
- Nest thermostats (Solarium, Living Room, Bedroom)
- Google Nest cameras
- Google smart speakers
- Petlibro feeder + fountain (unplugged, seasonal)

### Crosstown (West Roxbury)
- Philips Hue lights
- Cielo Breez Plus smart AC controllers (Basement, Living Room, Dylan's Office, Bedroom)
- Mysa baseboard heaters (Cat Room, Basement door, Movie room)
- iRobot Roombas — Roomba Combo 10 Max + scoomba J5 (local MQTT via MacBook Pro)
- Eight Sleep Pod 3 (cloud API, both sides: Dylan left, Julia right)
- Petlibro Granary Smart Feeder + Dockstream 2 Cordless Fountain (cloud API)
- Google smart speakers
- Litter-Robot 4 (cloud API via pylitterbot, tracks Sopaipilla + Burrito weights)
- August Wi-Fi Smart Lock (5th gen, front door — cloud API via august-api on MBP)

### Vacancy Automation
When a house becomes `confirmed_vacant` (both people detected at the other location), the `vacancy-actions` LaunchAgent automatically: turns off lights, sets thermostat to eco, turns off Cielos (Crosstown only), locks front door (August), and starts all Roombas. iMessage notification sent for lock status.

## Eight Sleep Pod

CLI at `/opt/homebrew/bin/8sleep`. Controls the Pod 3 (King) at Crosstown. Both sides: Dylan (left), Julia (right).

```bash
8sleep status                  # Both sides: temp, state, water
8sleep sleep dylan              # Last night's sleep (score, duration, stages)
8sleep sleep julia 2026-04-01   # Specific date
8sleep temp dylan -30           # Set temp (-100 to +100)
8sleep off julia                # Turn off side
8sleep on dylan                 # Resume smart schedule
8sleep device                   # Device info, firmware, connectivity
```

- Sleep data is keyed by **wake-up date** (today), not bedtime (yesterday)
- Env vars (`EIGHTSLEEP_*`) loaded from `~/.openclaw/.secrets-cache`
- Token cache at `~/.config/eightctl/token-cache.json` (auto-refreshes)
- API rate-limits aggressively on repeated auth failures — wait 5-10 min

## August Smart Lock

CLI at `/opt/homebrew/bin/august`. Controls the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock (5th gen) on Crosstown front door.

```bash
august status       # Lock state, door position, battery, WiFi signal
august lock         # Lock the front door
august unlock       # Unlock the front door
august locks        # List all locks on account
```

- Account: `dylanbochman@gmail.com`
- Lock: "Front Door" at "Potato's House", serial L5V82000F7
- Auth: JWT token via installId (cached at `~/.openclaw/august/config.json` on MBP, ~120 day expiry)
- Re-auth: `august authorize` then `august validate <code>` (sends 6-digit code to email)
- Architecture: SSH to MBP → Node.js august-cmd.js → August cloud API
- Auto-locks on vacancy via `vacancy-actions.sh` (checks status first, texts result)

## Image Tool — Path Policy

The `image` tool is restricted to workspace paths (`tools.fs.workspaceOnly: true`). Always save images to `~/.openclaw/workspace/tmp/` before passing them to the image tool — never use `/tmp` or `~/Downloads`.

```bash
# Good
cp /tmp/screenshot.png ~/.openclaw/workspace/tmp/screenshot.png
# Then use: image(path="~/.openclaw/workspace/tmp/screenshot.png")
```

## GWS (Google Workspace CLI)

CLI at `/opt/homebrew/bin/gws` (**pinned at v0.4.4**, Rust binary). Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Tasks. Do NOT bump — 0.22.x is a breaking redesign that drops `--account` in favor of per-account `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CONFIG_DIR` dirs. See `openclaw/plans/gws-0.22-migration.md` for the full migration plan before upgrading.

- Command pattern: `gws <service> <resource> <method> [--params '<JSON>'] [--json '<JSON>'] [--account <email>]`
- Credentials: AES-256-GCM encrypted at `~/.config/gws/`
- **DANGER: `gws auth logout` without `--account <email>` NUKES ALL accounts**

### Accounts

| Account | Owner | Flag |
|---|---|---|
| `dylanbochman@gmail.com` | Dylan | Default (no flag needed) |
| `julia.joy.jennings@gmail.com` | Julia | `--account julia.joy.jennings@gmail.com` |
| `bochmanspam@gmail.com` | Dylan (spam) | `--account bochmanspam@gmail.com` |
| `clawdbotbochman@gmail.com` | OpenClaw | `--account clawdbotbochman@gmail.com` |

### Skills

| Skill | Details |
|---|---|
| `gws-calendar` | Calendar read/write, event creation, availability |
| `gws-gmail` | Email search, read, send, label, archive |
| `gws-drive` | File search, read, create, share |

## Pinchtab (Browser Automation)

CLI at `/opt/homebrew/bin/pinchtab` (v0.11.0). Headless Chrome control for web tasks. The native binary lives at `~/.pinchtab/bin/<version>/pinchtab-darwin-arm64`; the npm `pinchtab` shim resolves it.

### Lifecycle

```bash
pinchtab &       # Start server (Chrome headless, port 9867)
sleep 5
# ... do work ...
pkill -f pinchtab 2>/dev/null || true   # Always clean up
```

### Common Commands

```bash
pinchtab nav <url>                  # Navigate
pinchtab snap -i -c                 # Snapshot interactive elements (compact)
pinchtab click <ref>                # Click element by ref from snapshot
pinchtab type <ref> <text>          # Type into element
pinchtab fill <ref|selector> <text> # Fill input directly
pinchtab press Enter                # Press key
pinchtab eval "document.title"      # Run JavaScript
pinchtab text                       # Extract readable page text
pinchtab ss -o /tmp/screenshot.png  # Screenshot
```

### Gotchas

- React SPAs: `element.click()` via `eval` may not fire React handlers — use `pinchtab click <ref>` instead.
- Always `pkill -f pinchtab` when done (auto-spawned servers persist past `daemon stop`).
- v0.11.0+: `security.allowEvaluate` defaults off (eval returns 403). Profiles now at `~/.pinchtab/profiles/<name>/`. v0.11 transition details: `qmd query "pinchtab 0.11 upgrade"`.

## iMessage

Active transport is native OpenClaw `imessage`, backed by `/opt/homebrew/bin/imsg` and the local Messages database at `~/Library/Messages/chat.db`.

### Quick Reference

```bash
openclaw channels status --probe --channel imessage
openclaw message send --channel imessage --target chat_id:171 --message "..."
imsg status --json
imsg chats --limit 10 --json
```

- Dylan DM: `chat_id:171`
- Julia DM: `chat_id:1`
- Dylan & Julia group: `chat_id:170`
- Current cron deliveries use `channel: "imessage"` with `chat_id:*` targets.
- Native iMessage accepts handles and explicit prefixes (`imessage:`, `sms:`, `auto:`, `chat_id:`, `chat_guid:`, `chat_identifier:`), but prefer `chat_id:*` for known stable chats.
- Do **not** use BlueBubbles `any;-;` or `any;+;` targets during normal operation.
- Reaction types remain: `love`, `like`, `dislike`, `laugh`, `emphasize`, `question`.

## BlueBubbles Rollback Only

BlueBubbles remains installed only as a rollback path during the native iMessage soak. OpenClaw runtime config uses `channels.imessage`, not `channels.bluebubbles`, and live cron jobs deliver through native iMessage.

Do not troubleshoot routine iMessage delivery by restarting BlueBubbles. First check native iMessage with:

```bash
openclaw channels status --probe --channel imessage
tail -120 ~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.log | grep -i imessage
imsg status --json
```

If Dylan explicitly asks for rollback testing:

```bash
set -a
source ~/.openclaw/.secrets-cache
set +a
openclaw message send --channel bluebubbles --target "any;-;${DYLAN_EMAIL}" --message "BlueBubbles rollback test" --json
```

BB targets are historical and rollback-only: DM GUIDs use `any;-;<address>`, group GUIDs use `any;+;<chat-identifier-hex>`. Detailed BB internals live in archived plans; search `qmd query "bluebubbles rollback"` or `qmd query "bluebubbles private API"` if rollback is actually active.

## FindMy Locate

CLI at `~/.openclaw/bin/findmy-locate`. Locates Dylan, Julia, or both via Apple FindMy screenshots using Peekaboo screen automation.

```bash
findmy-locate dylan     # Screenshot of Dylan's map pin
findmy-locate julia     # Screenshot of Julia's map pin
findmy-locate both      # Single pass: Dylan then Julia
```

Returns JSON with the screenshot path. **Read the screenshot image** to determine street address, neighborhood, or proximity to known locations. After locating, consider using the **places** skill (`goplaces`) for nearby search, directions, or recommendations.

- Captures saved to `~/.openclaw/findmy-locate/`
- Requires Peekaboo Screen Recording + Accessibility TCC grants
- Must run from GUI context (LaunchAgent or local terminal, not SSH)
- People sidebar order: Me (0) → Dylan (1) → Julia (2)

## Presence Detection

Script at `~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/presence-detect.sh`. Sticky/arrival-based model: once detected at a location, person stays until detected at the other.

- `cabin` mode runs on Mini (Starlink gRPC), `crosstown` on MacBook Pro (ARP scan), `evaluate` correlates both
- States: **occupied** / **confirmed_vacant** / **possibly_vacant**
- For device fingerprints, output files, and gotchas: `qmd query "presence detection"`

**Read presence data with Bash, not node tools.** The presence files live locally on the Mac Mini gateway — just `cat ~/.openclaw/presence/state.json`. Never use `dir_list` or `file_fetch` for this; those are node tools for remote paired devices and will always fail here (zero nodes paired).

## Node Tools (dir_list, file_fetch, dir_fetch, file_write)

These tools are part of the `file-transfer` plugin (added v2026.5.3) and operate **exclusively on remote paired nodes** — think iPhones or Macs running the OpenClaw node app. They require a valid node handle from the registry.

**This setup has zero paired nodes.** `openclaw nodes status` returns `Known: 0 · Paired: 0 · Connected: 0`. The file-transfer plugin is also not configured in `openclaw.json`. Every node handle you try — `auto`, `host`, `localhost`, `mini`, `gateway`, anything — will return `error: unknown node`.

**Never use node tools to access local gateway files.** For any file under `~/.openclaw/`, use `Bash` directly or the skill's documented commands. Node tools are only relevant if a node device is explicitly paired in the future via `openclaw nodes` or the `node-connect` skill.

## Crosstown Network

Mac Mini → MacBook Pro SSH via Tailscale (`ssh dylans-macbook-pro`), dedicated key `~/.ssh/id_mini_to_mbp` (bypasses 1Password agent — hangs under launchd). Configured via `Match originalhost` in `~/.ssh/config`.

## Financial Dashboard

Repo `~/repos/financial-dashboard/` on Mini; canonical finance API and SPA on port 8585. The weekly cron `financial-scrape-0001` (Sundays 4:05 ET) runs 7 scrapers, all self-healing:

- **Tier 1** — Tesla Solar (API only).
- **Tier 2** — Eversource, NG Electric, NG Gas, BWSC, PennyMac. Playwright with `--re-auth` flag; each saves `storage_state.json` in its `.NAME_session/` dir. PennyMac auto-fetches email-MFA codes from Julia's Gmail via `gws`. Creds at `op://OpenClaw/<url-style-title>/...`.
- **Tier 2b** — BoA. Bot detection defeats every Playwright-launched approach, so the scraper uses a narrow raw-CDP WebSocket to Pinchtab's already-running Chrome (port discovered by `ps`-grep for `--user-data-dir=~/.pinchtab/profiles`). After stale cookie replay and an explicitly `not_authenticated` tab, cron may run one `--boa-re-auth` submission; it stops for MFA or any challenge. Never navigate or close Pinchtab Chrome in CDP mode.

Cron prompt at `openclaw cron list --json` (id `financial-scrape-0001`) is the canonical operational spec. Its BoA and PennyMac import commands also run the weekly-gated Redfin estimate refresh under the household's existing written permission; a provider failure preserves the prior value. Dev architecture: `~/repos/financial-dashboard/CLAUDE.md`. Reusable patterns: skills `playwright-email-mfa-flow`, `playwright-device-trust-bootstrap`, `web-auth-check-by-title-not-url`.

Production source sync is deliberately separate from that cron: `ai.openclaw.finance-refresh` runs daily at 06:15 local time, invokes the cache-only Plaid wrapper before the crypto wrapper, and never invokes `op`. It writes combined status-only metadata to `~/.openclaw/finance-refresh/status.json` while preserving each component status; `not running` is normal between scheduled executions. The canonical Forecast financial source is `http://127.0.0.1:8585/api/forecast-baseline`, which exposes reconciled aggregate scopes only.

If the same joint account is visible through separate owner logins, treat it as a cross-Item Plaid alias, not two household balances. After verifying the identity, run `./venv/bin/python3 update_data.py reconcile-alias-account ALIAS_ACCOUNT_ID CANONICAL_ACCOUNT_ID "same physical joint account"`. The alias remains raw/auditable but is excluded from canonical transactions, balances, holdings, and Forecast inputs. Ownership tags do not deduplicate sources.

## Forecast Dashboard

Repo `~/repos/Financial Advisor/` on Mini; interactive forecast dashboard on port 8586. It reads `8585` first through localhost, validates the reconciliation and source-coverage gate, then caches `/api/current-snapshot` for five minutes.

- Live inputs: source-backed starting equity/bond/cash allocation, mortgage balances, and provenance-marked Redfin property values; trailing-three-complete-month cash flow is calibration context, not a gross-model input.
- Model supplements: crypto/art, compensation, salaries, reviewed property fallback values, and any owner scope without a complete linked source.
- Ownership rule: Combined adds the household scope once. Never infer a missing owner scope as a zero balance.
- Operational reference: `~/dotfiles/openclaw/FORECAST-DASHBOARD.md`.

## Dashboards

| Dashboard | Port | Data |
|---|---|---|
| Nest Climate | 8550 | Thermostat + weather + presence |
| Usage | 8551 | Token consumption + agent activity |
| Dog Walk | 8552 | Walk history, Fi GPS, Roomba status, route maps |
| Financial | 8585 | Canonical finance, utilities, mortgage, source reconciliation, and forecast baseline |
| Forecast | 8586 | Interactive projections seeded from the reconciled current-day baseline |

For API endpoints and UI features: `qmd query "nest dashboard API"` etc.
